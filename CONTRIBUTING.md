### Code of conduct

All contributors are expecting to abide by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Opening Issues

Before opening an issue, please follow those steps:

- Search existing [issues](https://github.com/braincube-io/python-connector/issues) for your problem.
- [Update](#update-version) your Braincube-Connector.

Finally, if you are up to date, supported, have collected information about the problem, and have the best reproduction instructions you can give, you are ready to [open an issue](https://github.com/braincube-io/python-connector/issues/new/choose):

- Fill out the provided issue template.
- Describe your problem, not your solution.
- Explain how to reproduce the issue.

### Update Version

Please ensure you use the latest version of the connector before filling an issue. Here is the command to use to update the connector if you installed it with pip:

```bash
pip install braincube_connector -U
```

### Install

The project uses [poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage the configuration and the package building.

To install `braincube_connector` run

```bash
poetry install
```

This will install all the project dependencies.  To run a command within the project virtual environment run

```text
$ poetry run <command>
# or
$ poetry shell
(.venv) $ <command>
```

Next it is recommended to install the git hooks so that several tests are run before each commit:

```
poetry run pre-commit install -t pre-commit -t pre-push
```

`pre-commit` runs the continuous integration tests before a commit or a push depending on the configuration.  
You can manually run the configured tests with `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files`

**Note:** pre-commit behavior is configured within the `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

### Style

The code style is fixed with the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) library:

```bash
black braincube_connector
```

The overall quality is checked with the `flake8` and several extensions provided by the [`wemake-python-styleguide`](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/violations/index.html#external-plugins) package.  

```bash
flake8 braincube_connector
```

`flake8` has a few parameters set: `max-line-length = 100`, `inline-quotes = "`

A few violations could not be fixed and were ignored in the `.flake8` file:  

- [`I001` isort found an import in the wrong position](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-isort/)
  → Incompatible with `WPS318`, `WPS319`, and `black`.
- [`I002`: no configuration found (.isort.cfg or [isort] in configs)](https://github.com/gforcada/flake8-isort#error-codes)
- [`DAR401`: Missing exception(s) in Raises section: -r KeyError](https://github.com/terrencepreilly/darglint#error-codes)
- [`WPS326`: Found implicit string concatenation](https://wemake-python-stylegui.de/en/latest/pages/usage/violations/consistency.html#wemake_python_styleguide.violations.consistency.ImplicitStringConcatenationViolation)
  → Incompatible with `black`
- [`C812`, `815`: missing trailing comma](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-commas/#errors)
  → Incompatible with `black`
- [`D100`: Missing docstring in public module](http://www.pydocstyle.org/en/5.0.2/error_codes.html#grouping)
- [`RST`: Ignore rst format related warnings.](https://github.com/peterjc/flake8-rst-docstrings)
  → Incompatible with `**kwargs` gets confused with `**title` in rst format. Removing this warning has no effect since we are using markdown.

#### docstring style

The `braincube_connector` project uses the google docstring styles:

```python
def function(val: int) -> int:
	""" Description of the functions.

	Args:
		val: val parameter.

	Return:
		a multiplication of val.
	"""
    return 2*val
```

#### Type hint

Since python 3.5, there is the possibility to use the type hints on the function definitions. It should help detect an important number errors and enforce better practice so we decided to incorporate it in the project.

The consistence of the type hints is checked with  [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/):

```
mypy braincube_connector/
```

### Test

The test suite rely on the to libraries [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and  [pytest_mock](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-mock).

To run the tests, simply run the following command:

```bash
poetry run pytest tests/*
```

To ease development phase, we use [`pytest-watch`](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-watch/). You can run it like this :

```bash
poetry run ptw --config pytest-watch.conf.ini
```

Once running, you can edit files, and tests will be run when you save your file.

### Continuous integration (CI)

At every push on the project the  CI executes a set of action defined in the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` script.

- Setup project environment (with `poetry`)
- Check the type hint consistency (with `mypy`)
- Fix the code style (with `black`)
- Check the style (with `flake8`)
- Run the test suite (with `pytest`)
